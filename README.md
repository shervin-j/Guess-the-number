# Guess-the-number
This is a simple number guessing game.

you should guess a number between 0-100, and by default you have 6 chances to guess it, but you can change the range and chance number in code easily.
it has a little voice command which tell you that the actuall number is higher or lower than your geuss.

have fun!
